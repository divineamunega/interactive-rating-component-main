## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Basic Dom Manipulation With Javascript

### What I learned
Well this challenge was relatively easy...... I learned that you can add an event listener inside an event listener in javascript... I have never thought of it like that before. Mindblowing right? ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯!!!


### Continued development

I'm stil focusing on vannilla javascript (for now) maybe REACT later.
